### General Information
The project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features. The background of the project is to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in estimating the market value of houses. By leveraging historical data and machine learning techniques, the project addresses the business problem of providing accurate and reliable price predictions to aid in decision-making.

The dataset used for this project consists of housing data, including attributes such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant features. It also includes the corresponding sale prices of the houses. The dataset is a valuable resource for training and evaluating the house price prediction model.

### Conclusions
The machine learning model successfully predicts house prices with reasonable accuracy based on the given features.
Features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location significantly influence house prices.
The model can assist buyers and sellers in estimating the fair market value of houses, enabling informed decision-making.
Further refinement and exploration of additional features may improve the model's predictive performance and accuracy.
